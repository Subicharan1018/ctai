# 🏗 Construction Tech AI (CTAI)

[🔗 **GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/Subicharan1018/ctai) · [🌐 **Deployed Solution (Ngrok)**](https://xglink.vercel.app/)

An AI-powered platform designed to transform the **construction industry** with smart insights, automation, and real-time project assistance.  
This project uses cleaned construction datasets to support tasks such as `MasterItemNo` classification and `QtyShipped` regression, and provides an interactive interface via **Streamlit**.

---

## 📌 Overview
Construction projects often face challenges such as delays, cost overruns, and mismanagement. **CTAI** helps tackle these challenges by:  
- 📊 Providing data-driven recommendations.  
- ⚡ Automating repetitive tasks.  
- 🧠 Offering AI-powered decision support.  
- 🌍 Deploying a user-friendly interface accessible on **Streamlit**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Simplify **construction project tracking**.  
- Enable **real-time collaboration** across teams.  
- Use AI to provide **insights and risk predictions**.  
- Make the solution easily accessible through the cloud.
